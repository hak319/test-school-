    <span class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of 
    the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2024, 98.8% of websites use <span class="js">JavaScript</span> on the client side for webpage behavior,
    [10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute the code on users' devices.
    <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
